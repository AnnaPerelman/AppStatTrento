## Summary

This course will provide biologists and bioinformaticians with practical statistical and data analysis skills to perform rigorous analysis of high-throughput biological data.  The course assumes some familiarity with genomics and with R programming, but does not assume prior statistical training.  It covers the statistical concepts necessary to design experiments and analyze high-dimensional data generated by genomic technologies, including: exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, linear modeling, principal components analysis, unsupervised clustering, cross-validation and bootstrap resampling methods.

## Evaluation

### Late Policy

Normal late policy is a 10% reduction per day.  Reasonable exceptions can be made if you let me know in advance that you will be prevented from completing part of the course on time.

### Labs

Each week will include a hands-on lab session, that students are required to hand in **before the following class** by committing to this Github repository. These are graded on effort as "Unsatisfactory or not done" (0/5), "Partial effort" (fraction/5), or "Full effort" (5/5).  Participation in the labs consitutes 35% of the final grade.

### Projects

A class project will be handed out after the second week of class, that will involve analysing a genomics dataset.  Students will present their projects in two ways:

1. A 20-minute project presentation on March 31 (20%)
2. A written report on the same project, prepared using R Markdown, due April 4 (45%).

Project presentations and reports will be graded for quality of analysis, but also for presentation style and clarity.  A grading rubric will be included in the project assignment.
