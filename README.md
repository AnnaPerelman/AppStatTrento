## Summary

This course will provide biologists and bioinformaticians with practical statistical and data analysis skills to perform rigorous analysis of high-throughput biological data.  The course assumes some familiarity with genomics and with R programming, but does not assume prior statistical training.  It covers the statistical concepts necessary to design experiments and analyze high-dimensional data generated by genomic technologies, including: exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, linear modeling, principal components analysis, unsupervised clustering, cross-validation and bootstrap resampling methods.

## Evaluation

Three components are required for class completion: 1) completion of lab exercises each week, 2) oral presentation of the final project, 3) written report of the final project.  See details below.

### Labs

Each week will include a hands-on lab session, that students are required to hand in **before the following class** by committing to this Github repository. You can work together on lab exercises, but everyone must hand in their individual lab.

### Projects

A class project will be handed out after the third week of class, that will involve analysing a genomics dataset.  Each student will analyse their own dataset and prepare an individual report. Students will present their projects in two ways:

1. A 20-minute project presentation on March 31
2. A written report on the same project, prepared using R Markdown, due April 4

Project presentations and reports will be assessed for quality of analysis, but also for presentation style and clarity
