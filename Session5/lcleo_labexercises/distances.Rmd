```{r}
library(BiocInstaller)
biocLite("genomicsclass/tissuesGeneExpression")
library(tissuesGeneExpression)
data(tissuesGeneExpression) #load the data
dim(e)

#1 How many genes for hippocampus?
table(tissue)
# 31 genes

#2 What is the distance between samples 3 and 45?
#Since the dist function computes distance for ROWS, we need to transpose e
#View(t(e[,c(3,45)]))
d <- dist(t(e[,c(3,45)]))
d
class(d)

#3 What is the distance between gene 210486_at and 200805_at
#View(t(e[c('210486_at', '200805_at'),]))
d2 <- dist((e[c('210486_at', '200805_at'),]))
d2

#4 It would have 
#r d = as.matrix(dist(e))
nrow(e)*nrow(e)

#5
d = dist( t(e) )
length(d)

#6
#C) Because we take advantage of symmetry: only lower triangular matrix is stored thus only ncol(e)*(ncol(e)-1)/2 values.
ncol(e)*(ncol(e)-1)/2
```
