#Based on the scatter plots, the 4 datasets are graphed in a different way.
#In the first and the third dataset there is a linear relationship between x and y. The third dataset has an outlier.

#Based on the diagnostic plots, even for the first and the third dataset that seem to be explained by the linear model,
#from the residual vs fitted values plots, we see that the residuals are not close to 0 (for the third dataset)
#and the Cook's distance has a big deviation from 0 (for the first dataset)
